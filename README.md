## Leetcode

*TLDR; leetcode is good if you don't care about winning, just write most
readable and maintainable code and have fun*

Leetcode is a web site for programming puzzles. The puzzles usually involve
computer science data structures and algorithms course work style stuff. As a
computer scientist I find them quite nice for exercise, there are few problems
with the system. The worst is that at least the python version times out quite
easily since most problems have at least one test with worst case huge input.
I get it that it either forces you to find the actual best time complexity
solution, however for casual problem solving I'd reckon giving non-optimal but
most readable and maintainable solution is more important. Sometimes it seems
that you even have to special case the worst case scenario to push a solution
through. That's just dumb. Another problem I have is that I have to code in the
web browser and I can only use very limited print debugging, it's very
sub-optimal. And copypasting to vim and running locally is also made hard since
the code lives inside a class Solution that is not provided.
